## Rust Implementation

You find a **Rust** implementation in the directory with the same name in the **aes_tbox** sub-directory. Change to the directory and run the following command to build and run **AES-TBOX**.

```bash
# Build & Run
cargo run
```

## C Implementation
./C/ ------- T-tableでの実装
./C_sbox --- S-boxでの実装

You find a **C** implementation in the directory with the same name. Change to the directory and run the following commands to build and run **AES-TBOX** on Linux.

```bash
# Build
cmake .
make

# Run
./AES-TBOX
```
